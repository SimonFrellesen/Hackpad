# Hackpad
This is my first ever project, it has taken me alot of time, but i finally think im done!
Its a Hackpad with inspiration from the Hackpad guide in Hackclub Blueprint.
Ive added an OLED and 2 SK6812 LEDs.

I made this project to learn and get experience. I love learning about things like PCB design and CAD design. Im interested in making more projects.

I want to give the keybinds some functions, which i havent decided yet. Probably Copy Paste and Back, and i want the LEDS to light up when i click any of the keybinds. The OLED is a starting screen.

3D printed case


(For Shadow: There is no functional or technical difference between .stp and .step files; they are the exact same 3D file format used for transferring 3D models between CAD programs. Both represent the Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (ISO 10303), with the only difference being the file extension name length. This is from google btw)
